# Police-Encounters

## About

This is an End-to-End project that goes through data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, visualizing, and modeling through machine learning. 

## Background

The data is comprised of 4 U.S census datasets on poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, and racial demographics. There is an additional file that The Washington Post compiled by traversing through multiple databases of  fatal shooting in the US by a police officer in the line of duty since 2015. But, many cases are not available and unreported. 

## Goal

The goal of this project is to explore the data and predict the race of the individuals involved.
